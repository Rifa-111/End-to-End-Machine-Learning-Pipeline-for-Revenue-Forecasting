🔍 Overview

This project implements a complete machine learning workflow for forecasting sales using historical transactional data. The system is designed to extract actionable business insights while maintaining strong predictive performance and reproducibility.

It demonstrates practical applications of regression modelling, feature engineering and performance evaluation within a commercial analytics context.

🎯 Objectives

- Forecast future sales using historical patterns

- Identify key features influencing revenue

- Compare multiple regression models

- Evaluate predictive performance rigorously

- Translate predictions into business insights

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

The exploratory phase included:

- Sales trend visualisation

- Seasonal pattern detection

- Revenue distribution analysis

- Correlation heatmaps

- Outlier detection

- Feature importance exploration

- Insights from EDA informed both model design and feature selection.

🤖 Models Implemented

The following regression models were trained and evaluated:

- Linear Regression (baseline)

- Random Forest Regressor

- Gradient Boosting Regressor

- XGBoost (if applicable)

- Each model was evaluated using consistent validation strategies to ensure fair comparison.

📈 Evaluation Metrics

Model performance was assessed using:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)

- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

- R² Score

- The best-performing model was selected based on accuracy, stability and generalisation capability.

🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python

- Pandas

- NumPy

- Scikit-learn

- Matplotlib / Seaborn

- XGBoost (optional)
